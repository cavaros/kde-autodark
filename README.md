> Enabling time-based automatic theme change

Must change $USER variable to your username at autodark.service, and also appropriately change the path to your `.autodark.sh` file.

Also must change `.autodark.sh` and replace `17:30` and `05:30` with the time to activate dark and light themes respectively.

Instructions in `suspend_instructions.md` show how to enable `suspend.target` for use with systemd's user group and `resumedark.service`.
